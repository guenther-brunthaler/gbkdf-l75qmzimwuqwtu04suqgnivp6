A custom PBKDF
==============

This document shall develop and describe the custom password-based key derivation function.

First, some considerations about already existing ones.

1. HKDF first compresses salt and password into a single hash then expands the result to the desired size. Obviously this cannot have stronger security than the size of the hash function's output.

2. PBKDF2 uses the password only as the key of a pseudo-random function PRF which is another parameter. Although applying an arbitrary PRF does not necessarily weaken the key per se, in practice HMACs are typically used as PRF. And those also limit the security to the size of the hash function's output.

3. OpenSSL's "EVP_BytesToKey" key derivation function derives each segment D_i of output material as D_i = HASH^count(D_(i-1) || password || salt) where D_0 is an empty string and HASH^n(m) = HASH(HASH^(n-1)(m)) and HASH^1(m) = HASH(m).

Of those 3 PBKDFs, only the OpenSSL KDF does not necessarily reduce the strength of the password to that of some hash function's output width.

However, there are still shortcomings in it:

* D_1 can be precalculated from a dictionary up to the point where the salt is added. But see below for the discussion "whether to put salt or password first".

* Repeatedly feeding the hash function its own output directly increases the risk of unkown attractors or fixed points to weaken the entropy in the hash. It would be better to modify the hash a bit before hashing it again, for instance by incorporating a counter value.

Discussion: Whether to put salt or password first?

Assuming that both salt and password are concatenated and included into the same hash, which order is the best?

As suggested in a previous paragraph, putting the password first creates the danger of pre-calculating the hash function up to that state and store the states for all passwords from a dictionary in a table. Therefore, only the salt needs to be brute-forced.

But if the salt is put first, it makes brute-forcing the password easier, because the hash can be precalculated once for the known salt, and then only all possible passwords need to be tried out.

Considering that the salt is likely to be larger than the password, it seems even better of putting the password first - just like OpenSSL does it.

However, there is a way to defeat both problems: Just include the salt twice - before as well as after the password! Then neither precalculation of starting values (salt) nor brute-forcing the inner loop (password plus salt) is feasible any longer.

The next problem is the danger of unknown attractors or fixed points in the hash function. Because of this, it does not seem a good idea to use only the output of some repeatedly hashed input as the next segment of the KDF result stream.

Instead, the results from recursive hashing should only be combined with the values from ealier iterations, such as by XOR or some other mixing function.

I therefore suggest a modified version of the OpenSSL KDF as follows and call it gbkdf ("gb" are my initials):

* It has 3 configuration parameters: An iteration_count <c> greater than zero, a cryptographic hash function <h> and a text/binary flag <mode>.

* It has two inputs: A salt and password; both strings according to <mode> of arbitrary size. In case of mode "text", the password should consist of a single line of text. The terminating newline character, if any, shall not be considered to be part of the password.

* The requested output pseudorandom material is created by concatenating as many D[i] as required to produce the requested amount of output key material, starting with D[1].

* D[i] is an empty string for i == 0

* D[i] := iter(c, D[i - 1]) for all i > 0

* iter(n, data) := data for n == 0

* iter(n, data) := h(int2bigendian(n) || int2pad(n - 1) || iter(n - 1, data) || int2pad(n - 1) || salt || int2pad(n - 1) || password || int2pad(n - 1) || salt) for all n > 0

* stretch(s, minlen) := s for all string_length(s) >= minlen

* stretch(s, minlen) := s || string_prefix(repeat_string(s, 1), string_length(s) - minlen) for all string_length(s) < minlen

* repeat_string(s, n) := int2bigendian(n) || int2pad(n - 1) || repeat_string(s, n + 1)

* int2bigendian(u) is <mode>-specific: For text mode, it is just the decimal ASCII representation of u with as few digits as possible (i. e. no  superfluous leading zero digits). For binary mode, it is the binary big-endian base-256 representation of unsigned integer u in as few octets as possible (i. e. without superfluous leading zero octets).

* int2pad(n) produces n ASCII 'U' characters in text mode and n octets with value 0xAA in binary mode. "U" (0x55) and 0xAA have the same regular bit  pattern of alternating "0" and "1" bits, except that all the bits of both  values are inverted when compared against each other. The actual value of the padding octets is rather unimportant (see below). But it seemed to be a good idea that the octet values inject the same number of 0 and 1 bits into the hash function, so 0x55 and 0xAA was chosen. The purpose of int2pad() is to avoid repeatedly feeding components like password and salt at the same offsets into the hash function during different steps of the iteration. This may strengthen the KDF against symbolic evaluation optimization attacks, because symbolic variables (the input bytes to be hashed) will be assigned differently for every iteration. It also means that iter() will take more time to compute the larger the iteration count c gets. This is exactly why an iteration count might be used at all: To artificially increase processing time, making brute force attacks on the password more costly.

* Salt should be a randomly chosen binary string of at least 128 bit (16 bytes) in binary mode, but 256 bit (32 bytes) or even 512 bit (64 bytes) might be preferable. The absolute minimum size should be 64 bit (8 bytes), but this is not recommended and should only be used where encoded message size really matters. In text mode, it shall have the same bit size of the underlying binary data, but shall be represented as a hexadecimal string made of decimal digits and lower-case characters.

* The output key material of the KDF will have the same representation as the salt, i. e. a pseudorandom stream of bytes for binary mode or lower-case hex digits for text mode.

* The hash function <h> shall produce binary bytes in binary mode, and hexadecimal digits (using lowercase characters) in text mode.

* The password shall be encoded as UTF-8 (which is a compatible superset of ASCII, i. e. the password can also be an ASCII string if ASCII characters are sufficient).

* UNICODE normalization form "NFKC" SHOULD be used to represent the UTF-8 password. The command "idn -n" which is available on many *IX installations as part of the "libidn" package can be used for that purpose. However, the "idn" binary and its associated shared library require about 250 KiB (on x86-64) of installation space, which might be considered too much overhead for minimalistic installations. In such cases, the password SHOULD be restricted to ASCII characters which never require normalization. It is also possible to use the password as-is without any character set conversion or normalization, but this is disencouraged because the PBKDF will then depend not only on the password, but also on the environment characteristics (user's current locale, UNICODE default normalization format) of the system processing the script.

* This PBKDF is defined in a way that it simpifies to the following expression, if an interation count of 1 is chosen and the requested amount of pseudorandom output key material is not longer than the output width of the hash function: h(int2bigendian(1) || salt || password || salt).

* This PBKDF does not conceal the approximate length of the password against an attacker, if the attacker is able to measure the run time or electrical power demand spent by the algorithm. This is because the run time and power demand is roughly proportional to the password size. A previous version of this specification used password-stretching as a counter-measure against this, but this ideas has been dropped for the following reasons: Firstly it makes the algorithm more complicated than necessary if the passwords are already long enough. Secondly, it only helps if the attacker has limited resources and cannot afford to run brute-force attacks on all passwords and rather needs to select promising candidates, which of course would be passwords known to have a short-enough size. But being conservative, one needs to assume that the attacker does not have such limitations. Thirdly, there is no way to make a password which is too short secure. Not even the iteration count can help against this, because it only adds a few dozen additional bits of security to the password, which will still be too little for short passwords. The iteration count is therefore rather a counter-measure against mass brute-forcing of many passwords, but only increases the security of a single password marginally. If your password is too weak, no PBKDF can make it secure enough. Also, timing attacks can be counter-measured by different methods also: Random delays after the PBKDF has been run but before returning the results. Or randomly performing useless work before returning, just to hide the actual time for the PBKDF processing. The latter method also helps agains power-demand analyses - a threat which should not be forgotten in power grids making use of "smart metering".

* Although (as described in the previous paragraph) this PBKDF will not by itself conceal the password length against an attacker which is able to measure the power demand or processing timing of the PBKDF, such measurements will not provide any hints on the password contents themselves, because all bytes of the password are processed identically. However, this assumes the selected hash function also requires the same run time for all possible input strings of the same size. In other words, the run time of the hash function must not be data-dependent (for identical amounts of data). This is the case for all well-known cryptographic hash functions, but should be considered when selecting or designing a non-standard hash function for use by this PBKDF.

This PBKDF does not use XOR to feed the result of the hash function back to its input as suggested above, but rather includes password and salt in every application of the hash function. This will combat the effects of fixed points or hash function attractors as well, because the primary source of information - password and salt - are always used directly as part of the input to the hash function.

Avoiding XOR also allows easier implementation of the PBKDF in shell scripts, where there is usually no easy way of performing the bitwise XOR operation on larger blocks of binary data (or at all).

Note that the above requirements regarding the binary or hexadecimally encoded output of the hash function in fact represents a different hash function because its output is used directly without decoding it to binary (for text mode).

This is not a problem because the hash function is a parameter of the PBKDF anyway.

Another thing is the requirement for a binary salt (whether or not it is required to be hex-encoded). As there are no restrictions about the contents or maximum size of the salt, only its information content (entropy) actually matters.

It is therefore OK to use an actual binary salt or rather some sort of ASCII-encoded binary data as "binary" data, which may then in text mode be hex-encoded further.

For instance, using a truly random binary salt of 6 octets provides the same entropy of 48 bits as using an 8-character random-generated base-64 string with an entropy of 6 bits per character.

Note that a binary- and ASCII-based implementation of the algorithm will give different results; yet the security should be the same.

The rest of this text contains a reference implementation of gbkdf as a Linux shell script, using 10 iterations, MD5 as the hash function, and a 128 bit salt by default.

It operates in text mode, and outputs an infinite stream of hex bytes until its output stream is closed.

The requesting process read should therefore read as much as required from the script's output, and then close its input stream to make the script stop generating more key material.
